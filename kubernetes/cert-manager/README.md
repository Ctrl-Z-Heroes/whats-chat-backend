# Cert-Manager

The cert-manager uses a plugin provided by helm. The `init.sh` installs this for us.

You can run the below to get more information on the featues:

```sh
kubectl explain Certificate
kubectl explain CertificateRequest
kubectl explain Issuer
```

## Check the Certifcates

After the cert-manager has been applied to the cluster, we can check the certifcate generated by running:

```sh
cmctl status certificate <CERT-NAME>
```
